DLAI 2017 Team 2

## Introduction

This project is based on [NeuralKart](https://github.com/rameshvarun/NeuralKart/edit/master/README.md), which has been extended to use the minimap as input into a separate convolutional neural network as well as the introcution of LSTM layers to make current predictions based not only on the current input, but also on the past. 

## Set up
As this project is based on [NeuralKart](), it has the same dependencies. Simulations have been carried out using [BizHawk](https://github.com/TASVideos/BizHawk) emulator and Python 3.

### Python Dependencies
The following Python dependencies need to be installed.

- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Pillow
- mkdir_p

## Getting started
### Directory structure

/Lua contains all lua and python scripts needed

/Lua/weights contains the weight files for the NN for different tracks we've trained it on
